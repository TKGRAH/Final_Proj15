# Final_Proj15
Final Project for Python Class Fall 2015

Idea for the final project is an automated way to play dice rolls for the board game Risk. The code will roll dice depending on the number of attacking armies and defending armies as well as the number of times those dice have to roll to resolve the battle. The code will keep track of the total number of armies each faction gets per turn based on the number of provinces that faction owns, this also means factoring area bonuses for owning entire continents or zones. The code will also accommodate a certain version of the game that has the addition of power cards that add scenarios where additional units are added the battle or the players dice are buffed up by getting +1 added to their roles, etc. And if I manage to get all that done on time I would also like to create a part of the code to record the history of the game, who took what province and when, how many times it traded hands, and have it output Data vs Time graphs for largest armies, most provinces, etc.
